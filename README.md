# Simple website

Building a portfolio website as project0 of Harvard's CS50W program.
As per the project requirements, this is a static website that increases that utilizes all thats learned in lectures 0 and 1, on basic HTML and CSS, and Bootstrap4.
This portfolio mainly comprises of 4 html pages:
1. Home
2. Software
3. Videography
4. About me.

I have incorporated all the requirements, albeit I will most likely change it later on with more suitable ways to shows, such as the table showing my experience.
